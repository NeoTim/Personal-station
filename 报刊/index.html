          <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era<br>program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,<br> helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on<br>me."</li>
            <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by<br>Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about<br>breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
            <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the<br>military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and<br>other applied science.</li>
            <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to<br> head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000<br>different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate<br>on Earth.</li>
            <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br>creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time<br>to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
            </li>
            <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically<br>modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says<br>that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants<br>and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best<br>breeds."</li>
            <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
          </ul>
